LangGraph is a Python library designed for building stateful, multi-actor LLM applications.
It extends the LangChain ecosystem by enabling developers to define workflows as graphs instead of linear chains.
These graphs can contain cycles, conditional branching, and shared state, making LangGraph suitable for building agents.

One of the key advantages of LangGraph is its ability to manage state across multiple steps.
This allows agents to remember intermediate results, track decisions, and coordinate between different tools or sub-agents.
State management is critical in complex applications such as planning, reasoning, and multi-step problem solving.

LangChain, on the other hand, provides the foundational abstractions for LLM applications.
It includes prompt templates, language model wrappers, document loaders, vector stores, and retrievers.
LangGraph builds on top of LangChain but focuses more on orchestration and control flow.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular technique used to improve the accuracy of LLM responses.
In RAG systems, external knowledge is retrieved from a database and injected into the prompt before generating an answer.
This reduces hallucinations and allows models to answer questions based on private or up-to-date data.

A typical RAG pipeline consists of document ingestion, text chunking, embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval, and response generation.
Each step in the pipeline plays an important role in the overall quality of the system.
Poor chunking or retrieval strategies can lead to irrelevant context being passed to the language model.

Chunking is the process of splitting large documents into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces.
Smaller chunks improve retrieval precision but may lose context, while larger chunks preserve context but may introduce noise.
Choosing the right chunk size and overlap is a critical design decision in RAG systems.

Vector databases such as FAISS, Chroma, and Pinecone are commonly used in RAG architectures.
These databases store embeddings and allow efficient similarity search.
FAISS is often used for local development because it is fast, lightweight, and does not require external infrastructure.

Cybersecurity is an important field concerned with protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.
It includes topics such as network security, application security, cryptography, and incident response.
Although cybersecurity is unrelated to LangGraph, it may appear in the same document when data is not well separated.

In real-world datasets, documents often contain mixed topics.
For example, a company knowledge base may include information about software architecture, security policies, HR guidelines, and deployment procedures.
Without proper chunking and metadata, retrieval systems may return irrelevant information.

Large Language Models are increasingly being used in cybersecurity for tasks such as log analysis, threat detection, and security policy summarization.
However, LLMs must be carefully constrained to avoid leaking sensitive information or producing insecure recommendations.

Agent-based systems combine LLMs with tools, memory, and decision-making logic.
LangGraph enables developers to build such systems by modeling agent behavior as a graph.
Each node in the graph represents a step, tool call, or reasoning action.

In summary, LangGraph is best suited for building complex, stateful agent workflows.
RAG complements such systems by grounding them in external knowledge.
Both techniques are powerful, but they must be designed carefully to avoid noisy outputs and unintended behavior.
